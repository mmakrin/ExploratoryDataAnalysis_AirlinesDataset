This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an airline flights dataset containing 10,000 domestic flights in India. The analysis investigates how ticket prices relate to flight characteristics such as booking time, duration, number of stops, airline, and departure/arrival times.

The work was conducted as part of the Statistical Simulation course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of Cyprus.
